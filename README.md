# GithubHelp


This is just a helper for myself to help doing thinds on github that I rarely do, like adding a new SSH Key to a new computer, I probably did 3 times in my life, so It is something that I forget.
Sometimes the commands on some websites do not work, so I going for the trouble to make my list of commands that I will be keep using and as I get errors I will also add the errors and methods to correct.
